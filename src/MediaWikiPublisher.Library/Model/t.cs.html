      <h2>Paragon</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="pack://images/ME1 Paragon.png" />
      </p>
      <p>Paragon points are gained for compassionate and heroic actions. The Paragon measurement is colored blue. Points are often gained when asking about feel
ings and motivations of characters. </p>
      <p>Paragon or Charm dialogue choices (colored blue in dialogue trees) often lead to people being more open and friendly with Shepard, </p>
      <p>and can sometimes avert entire battles that would otherwise be triggered.</p>
      <p>Shepard starts the game with 3 open Charm ranks. The Paragon scale affects Charm and more as defined below:</p>
      <p>:10% - Opens 2 Charm ranks. Gives 1 Charm point.</p>
      <p>:25% - Opens 2 Charm ranks. Gives 1 Charm point. Bonus: 10% shorter <a href="pack://documents/First Aid">First Aid</a> cooldown.</p>
      <p>:50% - No charm ranks/points. Bonus: 10% maximum <a href="pack://documents/health">health</a>.</p>
      <p>:75% - Opens 2 Charm ranks. Gives 1 Charm point. Bonus: 5% reduction in cooldown on all powers. <a href="pack://documents/Achievement">Achievement</a>.</p>
      <p>After reaching 80% Paragon points, <a href="pack://documents/Admiral Hackett">Admiral Hackett</a> will give Shepard the <a href="pack://documents/UNC:
Besieged Base">UNC: Besieged Base</a> assignment.</p>
      <p>The "free" bonus skill points can be gained again if importing the character for another playthrough.</p>
      <p>
        <img src="pack://images/ME1 Renegade.png" />
      </p>
      <p>Renegade points are gained for apathetic and ruthless actions. The Renegade measurement is colored red. Many sarcastic and joking remarks are assigned
Renegade points. </p>
      <p>Renegade or Intimidate dialogue choices (colored red in dialogue trees) generally lead to people disliking and even fearing Shepard,</p>
      <p>and occasionally "encourage" people to tell or give more than they otherwise would. Like with Paragon/Charm options, Shepard can sometimes avert entire
 battles that would otherwise be triggered.</p>
      <p>Shepard starts with 3 open Intimidate ranks. The Renegade scale affects Intimidate and more as defined below:</p>
      <p>:10% - Opens 2 Intimidate ranks, gives 1 Intimidate point.</p>
      <p>:25% - Opens 2 Intimidate ranks, gives 1 Intimidate point, 10% reduction in weapon powers cooldown.</p>
      <p>:50% - 1 health regeneration per second.</p>
      <p>:75% - Achievement, opens 2 Intimidate ranks, gives 1 Intimidate point, 5% increase in damage/duration on all weapons and powers</p>
      <p>After reaching 80% Renegade points, <a href="pack://documents/Admiral Hackett">Admiral Hackett</a> will give Shepard the <a href="pack://documents/UNC:
 The Negotiation">UNC: The Negotiation</a> assignment.</p>
      <p>The "free" bonus skill points can be gained again if importing the character for another playthrough.</p>

      <p>Becoming a <a href="pack://documents/Spectre">Spectre</a> in Mass Effect opens 3 more ranks and gives 1 skill point in both Charm and Intimidate.</p>
